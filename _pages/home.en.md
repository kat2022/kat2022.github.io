<hr />
The goal of KAT is to build a general artificial intelligence platform to testing a machine how much knowledge it possesses, and how well it manages on knowledge-related tasks based on its understanding of knowledge. Similar to the examinations SAT, GMAT, it contains plenty of questions in the forms of cloze-test, multi-choice questions, reading comprehension questions, etc., and the machines are supposed to answer such questions.   For example, it tests the capacity of recently prevalent pre-trained language models, and evaluates their reasoning ability by answering related questions. 

KAT welcomes everyone to participate in two ways:
- Competitors: You are supposed to submit your results on related benchmarks, and finally get a ranking on related leaderboard;
- Contributor: You are welcome to submit your own questions under the permission of copyright and licensing.
